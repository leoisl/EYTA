We had 2248 ASTALAVISTA bubbles to be found by EYTA, but 1658 are repeated (represent the same event in different transcripts or strands)
590 ASTALAVISTA bubbles to be found by EYTA...
We had 2806 EYTA bubbles, but 667 are repeated (represent the same event in different transcripts or strands)
2139 EYTA bubbles considered
588 ASTALAVISTA bubbles found by EYTA...
2 ASTALAVISTA bubbles NOT found by EYTA...
743 EYTA bubbles mapping to exactly 1 ASTALAVISTA bubble...
9 EYTA bubbles mapping to >1 ASTALAVISTA bubble...
1387 EYTA bubbles that do not map to any ASTALAVISTA bubble...
From the above, 1146 EYTA bubbles map to another transcript of the SAME GENE of the shallow transcript (probably ASTALAVISTA error)...
From the above, 17 EYTA bubbles are chimeric (map to ANOTHER GENE)...
From the above, 224 EYTA bubbles that I cant explain...
Precision: 0.887331
